**This tool lets companies test coding skills online.**

It's a website where candidates can:

* **Write and run code** directly in their browser – no setup needed!
* **Solve coding problems** and answer technical questions.
* **Complete tests with a time limit.**

The system automatically checks the code, tracks what the candidate does, and helps evaluate their skills. It's like a virtual coding interview or test.
