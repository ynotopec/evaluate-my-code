# Assessment welcome page

This repository contains a static webpage for an online coding assessment flow where candidates can:

- write and run code directly in the browser,
- solve coding prompts loaded from a local question bank (`questions.json`),
- complete the assessment within a time limit,
- get an application score out of 10 based on passing checks,
- generate integrity events used for evaluation,
- track attempts and average scores across multiple challenges.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>.
