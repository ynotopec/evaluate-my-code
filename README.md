# Assessment welcome page

This repository contains a static webpage that provides a candidate coding-screen IDE flow and includes a tutorial section explaining what `screen-ide.coderpad.io` is, with key characteristics and source links. The editor now executes the actual in-app `test.js` file against `index.js` instead of returning a mocked run result.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>.
